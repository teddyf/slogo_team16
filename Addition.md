Slogo Analysis
====================

Estimation
=====

1. I think this will take me around an hour to implement.
2. I think I will need to add/update 3-5 files.  Need to update mappings for command to path for reflection, and I need to write the commands, each of which will take at least one class.  

Review
=====
1. This feature took about an hour to complete.
2. I tweaked exactly 3 files, as expected.  One for each method and the mapping resources file.
3. It took me multiple tries because I didn't work on the commands originally so I had to aquaint myself with them.

Analysis
=====
1. This was a new experience so I don't really know.  I'm guessing it would be easier though.
2. Give the backend a better explanation on what you mean by stamp.  It's quite vague.
3. It would have been slightly tricky but thanks to package organization, I still think it would have been Manageable.
